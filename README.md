# two_point_resistance

This implements the calculation of equivalent resistance between two nodes in a resistance network, detailed for certain examples in Wu2004 (DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/37/26/004)

Future improvements could include calculation of equavalent impedance from Wu2006 (DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/39/27/002)
